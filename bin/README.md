Spring Data in-Memory
=====================

The primary goal of the [Spring Data](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data) project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, in-memory and cloud based data services.

The Spring Data in-Memory project aims to provide a familiar and consistent Spring-based programming model for in-memory datastores while retaining store-specific features and capabilities.
